We implemented the calculation for Kaya Identity:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity


The Kaya Identity is an equation that expresses yearly CO2 emissions as a product of four factors:
• Population size (in millions)
• GDP per capita (in 1000$/person)
• Energy intensity (in Gigajoule/$1000GDP). Energy intensity is the energy needed to produce a certain
amount of economic value.
• Carbon intensity (in tonnes CO2/Gigajoule). Carbon intensity is the CO2 emitted for produced energy.
This number depends on the energy mix used (coal, solar, . . . ).
